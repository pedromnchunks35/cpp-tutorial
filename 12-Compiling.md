# Compiling stages
- Preprocessing
  - Editing the source code accordinaly to the headers like #define,#include and #if
- Compilation
  - Translation of the modified source code into an intermediate representation usually to target the architecture of the computer
  - It also involves performing syntax checking,semantic analysis and producing error messages
- Assembly
  - Converting the intermediate representation into assembly language
  - The assemblers then convert this code to object code (machine code)
- Linking
  - Linking this machine code with the other machine code files and libraries
